 */


/* notes for students
You must have a second .h file that you write that contains
any extra functions you write for your heap.  You will need additional functions.

In that .h file you MUST have a typedef that  defines the
type "Heap"  and the type "Node".  Heap must be the
struct that is your main heap,  Node must be the type that is stored in the heap.

typedef somestructhere Heap;
typedef someotherstructhere Node;
